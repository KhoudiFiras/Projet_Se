TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
   "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

1. Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
   for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
   form of a work.

   and/or sell copies of the Program, under the terms of this License.

3. Copying, Distribution, and Modification.

   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
   source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
   conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
   copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License
   and any non-permissive terms apply to the code; and give any other
   recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
   distribute such modifications under the terms of Section 3, provided
   that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) The modified work must carry prominent notices stating that you
      changed the files and the date of any change.
   b) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.

5. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
   run a copy of the Program.  However, nothing else grants you
   permission to modify or distribute the Program.

6. No Warranty.

   The Program is provided "as is" without any warranty of any kind,
   either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to,
   the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
